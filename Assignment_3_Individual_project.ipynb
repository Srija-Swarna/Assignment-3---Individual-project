Specifically, BertTokenizer and BertForSequenceClassification are used for tokenizing text and for defining the BERT model with a sequence classification task. Trainer and TrainingArguments are utilities for training the model, while DataCollatorWithPadding helps in dynamically padding the input data. The pipeline function is used for easy application of the model to new inputs. For evaluation, accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics is used to calculate accuracy"
